    """
    Test the `run_function` utility which executes a PHP function with optional parameters.

    This unit test mocks the `subprocess.run` method to simulate the execution of a PHP script
    that includes specific PHP files and calls a given function with parameters, if any.
    The purpose is to ensure that the `run_function` utility correctly constructs the PHP command,
    executes it, and returns the standard output.

    The mock is set up to ensure that `subprocess.run` behaves as if the PHP script was executed
    successfully, returning an output as expected.

    Mocks:
    - mock_subprocess_run (MagicMock): A mock for `subprocess.run` to prevent the actual execution
      of the PHP command during testing. It is configured to simulate a successful execution with
      a predetermined standard output.

    Assertions:
    - Asserts that `run_function` returns the standard output correctly processed as a string.

    Raises:
    - AssertionError: If the `run_function` does not return the expected standard output string.
